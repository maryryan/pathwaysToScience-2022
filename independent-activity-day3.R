## Today we will be looking at a dataset from the Environmental Protection    ##
## Agnecy (EPA) with information on chemicals released into the environment   ##
## by companies in Connecticut and Eastern New York. 

## Every time a factory or facility releases chemicals into the environment,  ##
## the EPA creates a score that accounts for factors like how much was        ##
## released, the size and location of the exposed population, and the         ##
## chemical's toxicity. Higher scores mean there is a higher potential for    ##
## impact on the environment and public health. If one chemical release has a ##
## score that is 5 times larger than another chemical release, then the       ##
## potential for risk is 5 times greater in the first release.                ##


## 1. A dataset named CTpollution is loaded into your environment.            ##
##    Use glimpse() to get an idea of what that data looks like.              ##

## 2. What is the earliest year we have data for? The latest year?            ##
##    HINT 1: think of this as the minimum and maximum year we have           ##

## 3. Which counties had the most reports?                                    ##

## 4. Which company has the chemical release with the single largest RSEI     ##
##    score? What was the year and what county were they in?                  ##

## 5. What is the smallest RSEI score in the set? How many reports or         ##
##    observations have that smallest score?                                  ##

## 6a. What is the average (mean) RSEI scores for each county?                ##

## 6b. What are the top 3 counties with the largest average (mean) RSEI       ##
##     scores? Are these the same as the top 3 counties that had the most     ##
##     reports?                                                               ##

## 6c. What are the bottom 3 counties with the smallest average (mean) RSEI   ##
##     scores?                                                                ##

## 7a. What are the median RSEI scores for each county?                       ##

## 7b. Are your top 3 and bottom 3 counties for median RSEI the same ones you ##
##     got for the average?                                                   ##

## 7c. What is different about the median and average RSEI scores? Does that  ##
##     tell us anything about whether we have lots of large scores or lots of ##
##     small scores?                                                          ##

## 8. Look at the average and median RSEI scores for your top 3 counties from ##
##    question 6b by year. Are the averages increasing, decreasing or staying ##
##    the same? What about the medians?                                       ##
##    HINT 1: try grouping by both county and year                            ##

## 9. Also look at the number of reports for your top 3 counties from         ##
##    question 6b by year. Are reports increasing, decreasing, or staying the ##
##    same?                                                                   ##

## 10. If you had to tell someone about what you were learning from this data,##
##     what would you tell them? No right or wrong answers here.              ##

## Telling a story

- Knowing how to tell a story is an important skill for journalists and scientists alike!

- Needs a **hook**, or what makes your story interesting

  - Might be the question you're asking, the area/population you're asking the question about, or where you got your data from
  
- Needs a **beginning**, **middle**, and **end**

  - Beginning: what's this story about? (what are we asking and why)
  
  - Middle: how did we get there? (what did we do to gather/investigate our information)
  
  - End: what did we learn?

## How to structure a story

.pull-left[
**Scientists**: Leaving the best for last

- Question we're trying to answer and why

- What population/data we're trying to use to answer the question?

- What did we do to the data to try to answer the question or how did we gather the data?

- What did the data tell us about our question?

- Conclusion/main take away

**Journalists**: Show them the headline first

- Main take away

- Question we're trying to answer and why

- What population/data we're trying to use to answer the question?

- What did we do to the data to try to answer the question or how did we gather the data?

- What did the data tell us about our question?

## Final Project

- Today you will have access to 3 public datasets:

  1. the EPA pollution/chemical release data we explored in days 3 & 4
      
      - It has risk scores for every chemical release from a factory that happened in 2007-2019, for any factory in CT or Eastern NY
      
  2. a full (clean) set of the CT cancer data we practiced tidying in day 2
  
      - It has the total number of cancer cases, by county, for 2 time periods: from 2008-2012 and 2010-2014

  3. a set of data with the number of emergency room visits due to asthma
  
      - There are total visit numbers for each year from 2010-2019 for each county in CT

---

## Final Project

- In **groups of 2-4**: explore any or all of these datasets using the skills from the past 4 days

- Try and answer some sort of question or be able to tell some sort of story using at least 1 graph **and** at least 1 summary measure

- Then write a short blog post/record a TikTok explaining what you found

- Some question ideas are listed out at the top of your `final-project-day5.R` file if you need inspiration

- We'll present our stories to each other in the last 30 minutes of the workshop!

---

## Moving your files!

- If want to access these materials after the workshop is over:

  - Next to each project there is a little icon of a moving dolly:
  .center[
  ![](moving-icon2.png)
  ]
  
  - Click that icon and select "Your Workspace" from the window that pops up
  
  - Do this for all the projects

## Getting R on our own computer

- You can download and install R here: https://cran.r-project.org/

- After you download R, you can downloda RStudio here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

### Data is tidy when every column is a variable, every row is an observation, and every cell is a single value
]


---

## Review: What is data?

- A collection of information, facts, or observations for reference or analysis

--

.pull-left[
- Made up of:

  - Observations

      - The smallest unit we're collecting data on

  - Variables

      - One of the questions we're collecting about our observation
  
  - Values

      - The answer to the question we're asking our observation
]

--

.pull-right[
- Quantitative variables: numbers!
  
  - Discrete (numbers only occur in "jumps")
  
  - Continuous (fractions/decimals OK)

- Qualitative variables: word descriptions!
  
  - Categorical (no order to descriptions)
  
  - Ordinal (descriptions have order/ranking)
]

---

## Review: coding

- Can assign a value to a variable using `<-`

```{r example review, eval=F,echo=T}
x <- 2
```

- Words can become values if we put them in `"quotes"`; the computer will think words/letters not in quotes are variables and that it should be looking for a value assigned to it

```{r example review2, echo=T, error=T}
y <- "cat"
y

z <- dog
```

- We can create a vector using the `c()` function
```{r example review3, eval=F, echo=T}
vector <- c(1,2,3)
```

---

## Data needs structure

- Do you organize your class notes? The files on your computer? The photos on your phone? Why?

--

- Making sure observations, variables, and values are stored in a **consistent** way makes it easier for us to find data points later because we know where to look for them!

## Principles of tidy data

.pull-left[
1. Every column is a variable

2. Every row is an observation

3. Every cell is a single value

]

## What's wrong with this data?

```{r tidy data example}
grades.df <- cbind(rep(seq(3),each=4),
                   rep(c("Math","Writing"),each=2,3),
                   rep(c(2008,2009),6),
                   c(15,12,22,10,12,16,13,23,11,13,17,14),
                   c(16,13,22,14,13,14,11,20,12,11,12,9),
                   c(19,27,24,20,25,21,29,26,22,27,23,31))
colnames(grades.df) <- c("student ID","testSubject","year","Fall","spring","Winter")

grades.df %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
    datatable(
    options = list(
      scrollY = 350,
      #pageLength = 100,
      dom = "t",
      ordering = FALSE,
      columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-left', targets = "_all"))
    ),
    rownames=FALSE
  )

```


--

- `Fall`, `spring` and `Winter` aren't really separate variables

--

- Column naming isn't consistent

---

## Recipe for tidy data

- Tidying data is like baking cupcakes

  - Some steps definitely need to come before others (mix your ingredients vs. baking)
  
  - But other steps it doesn't (really) matter if you do one before the other (adding vanilla vs. adding oil)

---

## Quick note: the pipe %>% 

- Sometimes we want to do several functions at once

- But this is really hard to read:
```{r example1, eval=FALSE, echo=T}
function1( function2( function3( data ) ) )
```

  - What function are we performing first? Do we have enough parentheses? Who knows!
  
--

- The pipe %>% allows us to take the output from one function and make it the input of the next function:
```{r example, eval=FALSE, echo=T}
data %>% 
function1() %>% 
function2() %>% 
function3()
```
  
  - Easy to see that first we perform `function1()` on the original data, then plug that output into `function2()`, then plug that output into `function3()`

---

## Step 1: general tidying

- We use `glimpse()` to get an idea of:
    
    - how big our dataset is (rows and columns)
    
    - what our column names are
    
    - examples of what values in the dataset look like

--

- We use `clean_names()` to make sure the column names are consistent

  - Makes sure everything starts with a lowercase letter and puts an underscore _ between words
  
--

- We use `pivot_longer()` or `pivot_wider()` to makes sure every column is a variable and every row is an observation

  - `pivot_longer()` takes a bunch of columns and collapses them into 2: one for the old column names, one for their values
  
  - `pivot_wider()` takes 2 columns (one with names and one with values) and expands them into many columns
  
  
---

## Step 2: data altering

- We use `arrange()` if you need observations in ascending descending order to manipulate them

- We use `mutate()` to create new variables

  - i.e., If we wanted a new variable that sums together 2 existing variables
  
---

## Step 3: get rid of the junk

- We use `select()` to keep the variables we want and get rid of the variables we don't need anymore

- We use `filter()` to keep the rows/observations we want and get rid of the ones we don't

  - i.e., If we wanted to get rid of rows with missing values

1. Organize your ingredients on the counter (variables)

  - Get an overview of what you're working with using `glimpse()`
  
  - Clean up your variable names using `clean_names()` (from the `janitor` package)

  - Use `pivot_longer()` or `pivot_wider()` to makes sure every column is a variable and every row is an observation

### Summarizing data can help us quickly get an idea of what’s going on with the observations as a whole and not get lost in the details

## Review: tidy data

- Data is made up of:

  - Observations: The smallest unit we're collecting data on

  - Variables: One of the questions we're collecting about our observation
  
  - Values: The answer to the question we're asking our observation

.pull-left[      
- Data is tidy when:

  1. Every column is a variable
  
  2. Every row is an observation
  
  3. Every cell is a single value

]
]

## Review: coding

- The **pipe %>%** allows us to take the output from one function and make it the input of the next function:
```{r example, eval=FALSE, echo=T}
data %>% 
  function1() %>% 
  function2() %>% 
  function3()
```

- We use `glimpse()` to get an idea of:
    
  - how big our dataset is (rows and columns)
  
  - what our column names are
  
  - examples of what values in the dataset look like
    
- We use `mutate()` to create new variables
```{r example2, eval=FALSE, echo=T}
data %>% 
  mutate( new_variable1 = function1(existing_variable1),
          new_variable2 = function2(existing_variable2) )
```

---

## Review: coding

- We use `case_when()` when we want a new variable to take on some value only when an existing variable meets some criteria

  - Example: We want a new variable that is 1 when `existing_variable1` equals "Yes", 0 when `existing_variable1` is anything other than "Yes"
```{r example3, eval=FALSE, echo=T}
data %>% 
  mutate( new_variable1 = case_when(existing_variable1 == "Yes" ~ 1,
                                    existing_variable1 != "Yes" ~ 0) )

```

---

## Learning from data

- When we gather data, we usually aren't that interested in the **individual** observations

- We want to learn about something **bigger** that the observations are a part of

---

## Data can be A Lot

- Can you tell what the story this data is telling?

```{r lots o data}
data(billboard)

billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    wk1:wk76, 
    names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "rank", 
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  arrange(desc(date_entered,week,rank)) %>% 
  datatable(
    options = list(
      scrollY = 350,
      pageLength = 1000,
      dom = "t",
      ordering = FALSE,
      columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-left', targets = "_all"))
    ),
    rownames=FALSE
  )

```

## Why summarize data?

## What do we want data to tell us?

## Describing data

.pull-left[
What ways might you use to describe a dataset?

.can-edit.key-decribe[
- 
]

]

.pull-right[
What ways might you use to describe a "typical" data point?

.can-edit.key-typical[
- 
]

]


---

## Describing categorical data

- For categorical data, we might want to:

  - Know how many observations are in each category
  
      - Counts

  - Know how large a category is compared to all observations

      - Percentages: $\frac{\text{# observations in a category}}{\text{Total observations×100}}$

---

## Describing quantitative data

- For quantitative data, we might want to:

  - Know what the smallest value of a variable is: Minimum

      - R function: `min()`

  - Know what the largest value of a variable is: Maximum

      - R function: `max()`

  - Know the distance between the maximum and the minimum: Range
      
      - R function: `range()`

  - Know what the center of our data is...


---

## How would you measure the "middle" of a dataset?

.can-edit.key-middle[
- 
]


---

## Journey to the center of the data

- Mean

  - The "typical value" of the data

$$\bar{x} = \frac{\text{sum of data points}}{\text{# of data points}}$$

  - R function: `mean()`

- Median

  - The "exact middle" of the data

  - 50% of data points are below the median, 50% of data points are above the median
  
  - R function: `median()`

- Mode

  - The most common value in the data
  
  - Doesn't have an R function! (But we'll get into visualizing this tomorrow)

---

## How different are our data points?

- We might also want to know how much our observations **vary**

  - Nice to compare how far away observations are from the center of the data (deviation) on average (standard)
  
$$\text{standard deviation} = \sqrt{\frac{(\text{datapoint}_1 - \bar{x})^2 + (\text{datapoint}_2 - \bar{x})^2 + \dots}{\text{# of data points} - 1}}$$

- When standard deviation is **large**, the observations vary from the mean a lot

- When standard deviation is **small**, the observations generally stay close to the mean

- R function: `sd()`


---

## Activity!

- Everyone grab a buddy & come to the whiteboard

- Take turns measuring your buddy's height

- Can we guess what the mean class height is? The median? The standard deviation?

`r countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when=60, top="10%", right="15%")`

---

## Summarizing in R

- Can perform each of the previous summary functions on their own, but it's much easier to perform them all at once

  - We use the `summarize()` function for this
  
```{r example4, echo=T}
# if we want to get the number of observations, minimum, maximum, mean, and sd of city mpg #
mpg %>% 
  summarize( n(), min(cty), max(cty), mean(cty), sd(cty) )

```

---

## Summarizing in R

- If we want to give this summary table descriptive column names:
```{r example5, echo=T}
# if we want to get the number of observations, minimum, maximum, mean, and sd of city mpg #
mpg %>% 
  summarize( number_of_obs=n(), min=min(cty), max=max(cty), mean=mean(cty), sd=sd(cty) )

```

---

## Summarizing in R

- If there are groups in the data and we want to find summary values for each group, we can use `group_by()`

```{r example 6, echo=T}
# if we want to get the number of observations, minimum, maximum, mean, and sd of city mpg 
# for each car class #
mpg %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarize( number_of_observations=n(), min=min(cty), max=max(cty), mean=mean(cty), sd=sd(cty) )

```

---

## Summarizing in R

- We can even use `group_by()` on multiple variables
```{r example8, echo=T}
# if we want to get the number of observations, minimum, maximum, mean, and sd of city mpg
# for each car class and number of cylinders #
mpg %>% 
  group_by(class, cyl) %>% 
  summarize( number_of_observations=n(), min=min(cty), max=max(cty), mean=mean(cty), sd=sd(cty) )

```

---

## Summarizing in R

- We can also use `arrange()` and `desc()` to order these summaries from smallest mean to largest mean:
```{r example7, echo=T}
# if we want to get the number of observations, minimum, maximum, mean, and sd of city mpg
# for each car class and number of cylinders #
mpg %>% 
  group_by(class, cyl) %>% 
  summarize( number_of_observations=n(), min=min(cty), max=max(cty), mean=mean(cty), sd=sd(cty) ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean))

```

## What is data?

.pull-right[

- A collection of information, facts, or observations for reference or analysis


]

---

## What is data?

.pull-right[

- A collection of information, facts, or observations for reference or analysis

- Usually about multiple subjects, events, time periods, circumstances, etc.

## What is data?

.pull-right[

- A collection of information, facts, or observations for reference or analysis

- Usually about multiple subjects, events, time periods, circumstances, etc.

- If you record it, and it provides knowledge about something, it's probably data!
]

---

## Data parts

- Observation

  - The smallest unit we're collecting data on
    
    - i.e., Person, state, country, company

--

- Variable

  - One of the questions we're collecting about our observation
  
    - i.e., Age, gender, income, existing health conditions, favorite music

--

- Value

  - The answer to the question we're asking our observation
  
    - i.e, 15 years old, female, $30,000, none, k-pop

---

## Types of variables

- Quantitative variables

--

  - Numbers!
  
--
  
  - Discrete (numbers only occur in "jumps")
  
  - Continuous (fractions/decimals OK)
  
--

- Qualitative variables

--

  - Word descriptions!
  
--
  
  - Categorical (no order to descriptions)
  
  - Ordinal (descriptions have order/ranking)

---

## Activity!


- Groups of 2 or 3

- Gather data about your group members

  - What's their name?
  
  - How old are they?
  
  - What's their favorite food?
  
  - What is their favorite hobby?
  
  - What school do they go to?
  
  - What city do they live in?
  
  - How many siblings do they have?

- Which questions give you *quantitative* answers? Which ones give you *qualitative* answers?

`r countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when=60, top="33%", right="20%")`

## Empirical data vs anecdotes

.pull-left[

- Anecdotal evidence: story/account/claim from a single source
  
  - Depends on exact circumstances - might changes from source to source
  
- Empirical data/evidence: information from several sources

  - If something is true, will probably see same thing reported by multiple sources

## Public data

- Much data is collected and used privately or for a price

  - Companies
  
  - Example: Nielsen TV ratings data
    
      - Asks people to install device on their TV to track what they watch, when, and for how long
    
      - Pays people for participating
    
      - Makes companies/people pay to access data
  
- Some data is public, though

  - Often collected by the government (federal/state/local)

---

## Public data

.pull-left[
- Federal public data sources

  - U.S. Census Bureau/American Community Survey

  - Bureau of Labor Statistics
  
  - National Center for Education Statistics
  
  - Environmental Protection Agency
]

.pull-right[  
- State-level public data sources

  - CT Department of Transportation/DMV
  
  - CT Department of Agriculture
  
  - [CT Department of Public Health](https://portal.ct.gov/DPH)
  
- Local public data sources

  - [City of New Haven](https://www.newhavenct.gov/cityservices/records/default.htm)

## Data to tell community stories

.pull-left[

- Last Words via The Boston Globe

  - [https://apps.bostonglobe.com/metro/investigations/spotlight/2020/09/last-words/](https://apps.bostonglobe.com/metro/investigations/spotlight/2020/09/last-words/)
  
  - Using data from death certificates and surveys to show how race and income determine:
    
    - how and why Massachusetts residents die
    
    - how those factors affect the quality/length of life and access to care

## Data to tell community stories
  
.pull-left[
  
- Heat and Health in American Cities via NPR

  - [https://www.npr.org/2019/09/03/754044732/as-rising-heat-bakes-u-s-cities-the-poor-often-feel-it-most](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/03/754044732/as-rising-heat-bakes-u-s-cities-the-poor-often-feel-it-most)
  
  - Is there a relationship between the hottest parts of a city and where people live by income?

## Community data to community stories

- Looking at raw data like looking at anecdotes

  - Difficult to see patterns
  
  - Also not always sure if data is giving us the **full context** of the situation
  
- Need to summarize to get the big picture

- Computers can help us keep track of lots of data

---

## R Project

.pull-left[

- R is a coding language specifically made for handling data, computing statistics, and creating data visualization

- Free and open source

  - New code is created/edited by users and given without cost to other users
  
- Makes it easy to **reproduce** what we do to the data

<!-- ## Public data -->

<!-- - Not all public data is easy to access/available on the internet -->

<!--   - Old paper records not digitized -->

<!--   - Too expensive to put in one big place -->

<!-- - Different states have different "open records" or "open meeting" laws - AKA "sunshine" laws -->

<!--   - Who can ask for access to what data for what reasons -->

<!-- - Connecticut Freedom of Information Act -->

<!--   - Any recorded data/information relating to the conduct of the public’s business prepared, owned, used, received, or retained by a public agency, or to which a public agency is entitled to receive a copy by law or contract -->

<!--   - Anyone may request public records - no reason needed -->

<!--   - No restrictions on the use of the records -->

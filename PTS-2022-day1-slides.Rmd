## What is data?

- 

---

## Data parts

- Observation

  - The smallest unit we're collecting data on
    
    - i.e., Person, state, country, company

--

- Variable

  - One of the questions we're collecting about our observation
  
    - i.e., Age, gender, income, existing health conditions, favorite music

--

- Value

  - The answer to the question we're asking our observation
  
    - i.e, 15 years old, female, $30,000, none, k-pop

---

## Types of variables

- Quantitative variables

--

  - Numbers!
  
--
  
  - Discrete (numbers only occur in "jumps")
  
  - Continuous (fractions/decimals OK)
  
--

- Qualitative variables

--

  - Word descriptions!
  
--
  
  - Categorical (no order to descriptions)
  
  - Ordinal (descriptions have order/ranking)

---

## Activity!

- Groups of 2 or 3

- Gather data about your group members

  - What's their name?
  
  - How old are they?
  
  - What's their favorite food?
  
  - What are their hobbies?
  
  - What school do they go to?
  
  - What city do they live in?
  
  - How many siblings do they have?

- Which questions give you *quantitative* answers? Which ones give you *qualitative* answers?

## Empirical Data vs Anecdotes

.pull-left[

- Anecdotal evidence: story/account/claim from a single source
  
  - Depends on exact circumstances - might changes from source to source
  
- Empirical data/evidence: information from several sources

  - If something is true, will probably see same thing reported by multiple sources

## Public Data

- Much data is collected and used privately or for a price

  - Companies
  
- Some data is public, though

  - Often collected by the government (federal/state/local)

---

## Public Data

- Federal public data sources

  - U.S. Census Bureau/American Community Survey

  - Bureau of Labor Statistics
  
  - National Center for Education Statistics
  
  - Environmental Protection Agency
  
- State-level public data sources

  - CT Department of Transportation/DMV
  
  - CT Department of Agriculture
  
  - [CT Department of Public Health](https://portal.ct.gov/DPH)
  
- Local public data sources

  - [City of New Haven](https://www.newhavenct.gov/cityservices/records/default.htm)
  
  - [DataHaven](https://www.ctdatahaven.org/)

## Public Data

- Not all public data is easy to access/available on the internet

  - Old paper records not digitized
  
  - Too expensive to put in one big place

- Different states have different "open records" or "open meeting" laws - AKA "sunshine" laws

  - Who can ask for access to what data for what reasons

- Connecticut Freedom of Information Act

  - Any recorded data/information relating to the conduct of the public’s business prepared, owned, used, received, or retained by a public agency, or to which a public agency is entitled to receive a copy by law or contract

  - Anyone may request public records - no reason needed
  
  - No restrictions on the use of the records

- Black Snow: Big Sugar’s Burning Problem via The Palm Beach Post

  - [https://projects.propublica.org/black-snow/](https://projects.propublica.org/black-snow/)
  
  - Collect own air quality measurements to check claims by local sugar company that sugarcane burning is not a threat to public health

  - Using data from death certificates and surveys to show how race and income determine 
    
    - how and why Massachusetts residents die
    
    - how those factors affect the quality/length of life and access to care

## Community data to community stories

- Looking at raw data like looking at anecdotes

  - Difficult to see patterns
  
- Need to summarize to get the big picture

- Computers can help us keep track of lots of data

---

## R Project

.pull-left[

- R is a coding language specifically made for handling data, computing statistics, and creating data visualization

- Free and open source

  - New code is created/edited by users and given without cost to other users
  
- Makes it easy to *reproduce* what we do to the data
